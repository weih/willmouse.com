    By day I earn my keep as a Web &amp; Software Developer &amp; Consultant. I've consulted in various areas including software development lifecycle practice, build automation &amp; release management. I have crafted software from a variety of materials including Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Oracle Fusion, Ruby, Rails, and Perl.

    By night I study a Graduate Diploma in Graphic Design at RMIT &amp; try to squeeze in a bit of freelance design &amp; web work.

    In my spare time (har har) I hang out with my family and watch an inordinate amount of Sesame St with my daughter. I also love cooking, juggling, reading, writing, drawing, painting, comics, movies, games, card magic, sci-fi, volunteering &amp; about a hundred other things. I look forward to spending more time doing them as soon as I figure out how to warp space-time to make my days long enough.
