These two wallpapers of [day owl][3] and [night owl][4] were some of the first things I drew when I was [experimenting with my new Wacom tablet][1] and Inkscape. Nothing too flash, but I thought I'd offer them up for anyone who was interested. 

<img alt="day-owl" src="{{site.url}}/img/posts/day-owl.png" width="320" height="480" style="padding:10px;" />
<img alt="night-owl" src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/night-owl.png" width="320" height="480" style="padding:10px;"/>

The wallpapers are available as PNGs in both iPhone (320x480) and iPhone 4 (640x960) resolutions and can be downloaded as a bundle [here][2].
