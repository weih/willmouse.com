Yesterday I came across [this short post][1] by Google developer Boris Smus, who while designing a new personal business card realised that his email address actually captured all of the contact information that he wanted to share &ndash; his personal domain, email address and twitter account.

  <img class="bordered" alt="screenshot" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/boris_smus_card_screenshot.jpg" width="500" height="221" />
</a>

I though that the idea was really neat so I hacked up a little example web interpretation of the concept. [Give it a try][2].

It's still a bit rough around the edges, but if you're interested in the code it's available in my [github repository][3].
