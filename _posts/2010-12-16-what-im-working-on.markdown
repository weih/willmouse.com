If you're connected to the design industry then you're probably already familiar with [Dribbble][1], a site for designers, developers and other creatives to post little sneak peeks their work as small screenshots which the site community can follow, respond to and offer constructive feedback on.

[<img class="bordered post-float-right" style="float:right;" alt="screenshot" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/dribbble_screenshot.jpg" width="250" height="220" />][1]There is no membership signup for Dribbble - to join you have to be offered an invitation by an existing member, thereby (at least theoretically) maintaining some control on the quality contributions and the culture of the community.

In practice, this can be a bit tricky on both sides - some people feel funny about asking around for an invite, while some members are uncomfortable having to judge or vet the work of people who ask them for memberships.

I haven't build much in the way of a portfolio yet to justify asking for an invite, but I really like the idea of playing show and tell with what I'm working on. The idea of socialising snippets of my output motivates me to stretch myself - to do more work, at higher quality and to be prepared for feedback. So I've decided to use the utterly awesome [Skitch][2] to create a dribbble-esque way of sharing screenshots. You can find the gallery [here][3] or via a new link in the _Stay In Touch_ portion of the site footer. 

Please have a look if you're interested, and any comments or constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.
