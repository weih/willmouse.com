Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? 


This is a short post for the soft launch of my new website and blog.

I've hacked most of the structure, but there are still a few corners to sand down and some furniture to shuffle before I get this thing nailed down. Over the next few weeks I'll be cleaning up the code, tweaking the styling, and then probably fixing anything that falls over as a result of my cleaning and tweaking. So if things change a bit over the next few weeks, don't be  alarmed - I'm doing it _on purpose_.  

If you encounter any problems with the site - broken links, crazy layout or formatting, strange content, ninjas - whatever -  please [drop me a line][1] and let me know.

Cheers

Dave
