Having just gone through the design and development process for this site, I thought I'd share a couple of nifty free color related web applications I've been playing around with. 

### [Kuler][1]

Kuler is a beautiful flash based color scheme generator. You can build completely custom schemes, generate from a base color using a variety of standard color scheme rules (Analogous, Monochromatic, Triad, Complementary, Compounds, Shades) or generate themes from uploaded images.

One of the interesting facets of Kuler is that is has a community of contributors actively providing feedback and a big library of saved schemes. You can use Kuler without registration, but if you login with an Adobe ID you get the ability to save and download schemes as Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE) files. And if you're using CS5 software, you can also access Kuler via a built in panel.

On the down side, schemes are restricted to a 5 colour palette. This wont suit everyone's needs, but should still provide a nice starting point for most projects. As someone who uses open source software like the [GIMP][4] and [Inkscape][5] pretty heavily, it would also be nice if they supported the GIMP palette format. However a cursory google suggested the availability of plugins to import ASEs, and as Kuler supplies a range of color codes (HSV, RGB, CYMK, LAB and HEX) at the worst you might have to cut and paste 5 values, which isn't really that big a chore.

### [0to255][2]

0to255 is tool designed and developed by [Shaun Chapman][3] that suggests a spectrum of lighter and darker colors around a selected base color. This is really handy tool for finding minor color variations for things like link hovers or text and border effects. It's beautiful, easy to use and a huge improvement for me over the convoluted (and to be quite honest, downright shoddy) process of guestimation and blind luck I'd been using previously.

I hope these are of some use to people. If you have any favourites or suggestions, please mention them in the comments.
