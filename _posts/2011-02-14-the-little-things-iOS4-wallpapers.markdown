Okay, so inspired by [Little Big Details][1] I've decided to start a new category I'm calling The Little Things, which will aggregate short posts on cool stuff I come across where I think that a design or experience is really enhanced because someone has really paid attention to the details.

So, this morning I was changing the wallpaper on my iPhone. When you do this you have the option of setting different images for the lock and home screens. 

If you set both wallpapers to the same image and slide to unlock there is a nice clean transition with the lock screen UI elements sliding off the top and bottom of the screen to be replaced by the home screen UI elements which slid back in. However, if you pick different images for each, as the lock screen UI elements slide out the wallpaper fades out to black and back into the new wallpaper as the home screen elements slide in. 

It would have been very easy to just have the wallpaper fade out/in for both situations, but instead each use case a distinct, clean and smooth custom transition. Nice.
